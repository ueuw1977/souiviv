  <h2>Article 1 (Scope of Application)</h2>
  <p>These Terms apply to all individuals or entities (“Clients”) who request or reserve guide services through The Guide Group (“the Group”). By placing a reservation, the Client is deemed to have agreed to these Terms in full.</p>

  <h2>Article 2 (Definitions)</h2>
  <p>1. “Group” means the organization that manages, coordinates, facilitates guide bookings, and is not a party to the contract.<br>
     2. “Member” means a registered guide who agrees to the Group’s internal regulations and provides guiding services.<br>
     3. “Client” means an individual or entity requesting guide services through the Group.<br>
     4. The Group acts as the coordinator and intermediary for guide services, ensuring smooth communication and scheduling, while the Member remains solely responsible for service delivery.<br>
     5. The Member who accepts an assignment bears sole responsibility for service performance, legal compliance, safety, communications, and dispute resolution.<br>
     6. The Group does not assume responsibility for defaults, accidents, injuries, illnesses, deaths, damages, losses, complaints, chargebacks, or disputes arising from services provided by Members.</p>

  <h2>Article 3 (Reservations and Deposits)</h2>
  <p>1. A booking is confirmed only upon payment of a deposit equal to 50% of the total fee via the platform at the time of reservation.<br>
     2. No services shall commence prior to confirmation of the deposit.<br>
     3. The remaining 50% shall be paid directly to the assigned Member on the tour day.<br>
     4. If the balance remains unpaid, the Member may suspend or refuse to provide services.</p>

  <h2>Article 4 (Payments and Billing)</h2>
  <p>1. The Group coordinates payments for guide services but does not act as a payment agent; final receipt of fees remains the responsibility of the Member.<br>
     2. Members are responsible for issuing receipts/invoices for amounts they receive; the Group may provide templates without assuming any responsibility.<br>
     3. All risks related to counterfeit currency, fraudulent or invalid payments are borne by the Member and/or Client; the Group assumes no responsibility for the validity of any payment.<br>
     4. The Group’s invoice, if issued, covers only the reservation handling fee (deposit). Any invoice for the remaining balance must be requested from the Member.<br>
     5. The Group is not responsible for resolving disputes regarding payment or refunds, which must be addressed directly between the Client and the Member.</p>

  <h2>Article 5 (Cancellations and Refunds)</h2>
  <p>1. Cancellations at least 48 hours before the scheduled tour start time: Full refund minus a 6% processing fee.<br>
     2. Cancellations 24–48 hours before the tour: 50% refund.<br>
     3. Cancellations within 24 hours of the tour or no-shows: No refund.<br>
     4. Refunds are processed through the original payment channel; bank/processing fees and exchange losses are borne by the Client.<br>
     5. The Group coordinates communication regarding refunds but is not responsible for resolving disputes, which must be addressed directly between the Client and the Member.</p>

  <h2>Article 6 (Meeting Point and Punctuality)</h2>
  <p>1. Clients must arrive at the agreed meeting point 10 minutes before the scheduled start time.<br>
     2. Tours depart no later than 15 minutes after the scheduled time; arrivals after 15 minutes may be treated as no-shows without refund.<br>
     3. Tour time begins at the scheduled meeting time, not upon the Client’s arrival; late arrivals do not affect billing.</p>

  <h2>Article 7 (Overtime and Additional Charges)</h2>
  <p>1. Any extension of the tour must be confirmed with the Member in advance.<br>
     2. Overtime is charged according to the “Overtime Add-on” listed in the package or as otherwise agreed.<br>
     3. Transportation, meals, tickets, insurance and other costs are excluded unless explicitly stated and are borne by the Client.</p>

  <h2>Article 8 (Weather and Emergencies)</h2>
  <p>1. Tours operate in regular weather conditions, including light to moderate rain.<br>
     2. In severe weather or official warnings (e.g., typhoons or storm alerts), a reschedule or full refund may be offered at the Group’s coordination.<br>
     3. The Group coordinates communication and possible rescheduling in case of emergencies, but does not assume liability for delays, cancellations, or additional expenses resulting from force majeure, transport disruptions, illness, or other emergencies.</p>

  <h2>Article 9 (Limitation of Liability and Insurance)</h2>
  <p>1. The Group acts solely as a coordinator and intermediary and does not guarantee the quality, safety, legality, or fitness of services provided by Members.<br>
     2. All claims regarding accidents, damages, injuries, losses, or disputes shall be directed to the responsible Member.<br>
     3. The Group is not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages.<br>
     4. Clients are strongly advised to obtain adequate travel/health/accident insurance at their own expense.</p>

  <h2>Article 10 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction)</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Japan. Any disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in Japan as the court of first instance.</p>
