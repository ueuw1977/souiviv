  <h2>Article 1 (Scope of Application)</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms apply to all individuals or entities (“Clients”) who request or reserve guide services

  <h2>Article 2 (Definitions)</h2>
  <p>
    1. “Group” means the organization that provides a technical platform for guide verification,

       in their own name and at their own responsibility.<br>
    3. “Client” means an individual or entity requesting guide services through the platform.<br>
    4. The service contract for the tour is formed directly between the Client and the Member.<br>

       arranged, the deposit will be refunded minus a 6% handling fee.<br>
    3. Cancellation timing does not affect the refundability of the deposit.<br>
    4. Refunds, where applicable, will be processed through the original payment method, and any
       third-party fees shall be borne by the Client.<br>
